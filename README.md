# Realty
Hello,

This is Realty, a one page real estate website built using HTML , CSS and Javascript.

The reason I built this website is because I recently learned about the impact of how parallax scrolling could look visually and how you can effects of the scroll by altering border colors, border widths and border widths.

It was a really fun project to built as it allowed me to explore different color schemes to find out what works and it taught me a lot.

This project taught me one very important skill as a developer. Don't Overcomplicate Things!.

When it came to the javascript filter functions that allows the website to show the properties wfhen certain buttons are clicked, I tried to create this excessive function using loops, nested if and else statements and 3 different arrays and while this worked in the console, it kept breaking the website or stopping it from loading entirely once the code was written on the javascript.

The most important thing for a developer is to make sure their product works and sometimes the path of least resistance is the most effective.

Essentially this is a dummy website with no back-end. Its sole purpose is to demonstrate that I am familiar with ES6 with arrow functions, let and const variables and to show that that I can build a static website that looks good, has filter logic and incorporates filter logic.

Eventually, this will not be a dummy website. The aim is to rebuild this using react and use a real estate api to show that the properties and play around and take this to new levels.
